Send a message with any of these commands inside your static private group.

For commands that ask you for usernames, 
use the discord username (i.e. DiscordLord#9999), 
make sure that every character and number is correct
and that you respect uppercase/lowercase.

`$add` - add members to this group. You can pass multiple people separating them by spaces.
    Example:
        `$add DiscordLord#9999`
        or
        `$add DiscordLord#9999 DiscordLady#1234`

`$remove` - remove members from this group. You can pass multiple people separating them by spaces.
    Example:
        `$remove DiscordLord#9999`

        `$remove DiscordLord#9999 DiscordLady#1234`

`$members` - list all members of this static.

`$mention` - mention (@ ping) all members of this static.

`$pin` - pin the last message or the replied message.

    If you reply to the message you want to pin with $pin, it will pin that message.
    If you don't reply to any message but still use $pin, it will pin the previous message.

`$unpin` - unpin the replied message.

    **You must reply to the message you want to unpin** with $unpin for it to work.
